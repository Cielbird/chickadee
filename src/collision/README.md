## glossary

### "correction vector"
given two colliding colliders (a, b), the correction vector for "a" is the smallest  translation 
necessary for "a" to no longer be colliding with "b". 

### "dynamic"
if a collider is dynamic, the engine will move the transform of the collider's entity if
there is a collision
